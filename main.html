"Gym" is also the commonly used name for a "fitness centre" or health club, which is often an area for indoor recreation. A "gym" may include or describe adjacent open air areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms" often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment and machines used for physical development training, or to do exercises. In many countries, Gymnasium also can describe a secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a university,
                     with or without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.</p>

                    A 3-ounce piece of skinless chicken breast contains 29 grams of protein, more than an equally sized piece of top round beef, turkey breast or salmon. 
                    Boiled chicken is favored by many bodybuilders for its high protein content and ease of preparation.There are about four grams of fat in one cup of boiled chicken breast. That's as much fat as about eight almonds, according to nutrition facts from the USDA. One cup of boiled chicken breast contains a whopping 39 grams of protein.
